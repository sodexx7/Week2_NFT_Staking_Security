##  Besides the examples listed in the code and the reading, what might the wrapped NFT pattern be used for?


1. Based on current NFT projects or non-NFT projects such as defi,  can expand more features to the original projects, such as governance token, and don't break down the original NFT features.

2. Sometimes, some people want to build a strong ecosystem based on the current NFT projects, so the third parties, perhaps, have no relationships with the current NFT projects. Build new projects based on the original ones, such as loot and BORED APE YACHT.
